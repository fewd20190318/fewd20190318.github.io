 Tips
 Focus on the content first, then the image then the CSS There will be some items that you will need to look up, CSS is one of them (don&amp;rsquo;t worry we will be going over this in the next class, but part of being a developer is being able to google your way to solutions)   </description>

 Download Atom
  Browser:
 Why?: Google chrome is a robust browser with a variety of tools that are helpful to developers.
 Install Google Chrome
  Github:

      <description>Recommended Folder Organization  Create a folder in your Documents (My Documents on Windows) folder called FEWD
 At beginning of every class, download and unzip (mac instructions | windows instructions) the &amp;ldquo;Lesson Files&amp;rdquo; for that lesson directly into your FEWD folder
 Over the course, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a neatly organized listing of all of your work that looks similar to this:

      <description>Do your homework: More you practice the concepts learned in class, the faster you&amp;rsquo;ll pick them up
 Don&amp;rsquo;t try to memorize anything: You&amp;rsquo;ll memorize things naturally through the act of doing things over and over again. Besides, if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember something just look it up (i.e. google).
 Work smarter not harder: In additional to looking things up, developers are really good at referencing past code that they&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past to solve problems they encounter in the present.</description>
